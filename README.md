# Build a TypingMind Plugin: Overview

This guide explains how to build a TypingMind plugin that integrates with the TypingMind platform. The documentation covers the following areas:

- **Introduction & Architecture:**  
  Learn about the conceptual model of a TypingMind plugin, which acts as a lightweight module that can receive input, process it using custom functions, and output results. Plugins can be used both to extend the editorâ€™s capabilities and to interact with external APIs.

- **Environment Setup & Configuration:**  
  Steps to set up your development environment. This includes installing necessary dependencies, configuring the plugin folder structure, and modifying user settings (such as the server URL).

- **Developing Plugin Functions:**  
  Instructions on how to define functions that the TypingMind plugin will expose. These functions are written in JavaScript and should follow the guidelines for input/output specifications. An OpenAI-style function specification is recommended to ensure that function parameters are well defined.

- **Plugin API Integration:**  
  Details on how to connect your plugin to the TypingMind platform by registering endpoints and how to use event hooks (such as onInput, onSubmit, etc.) for interactive features.

- **Testing and Deployment:**  
  Guidance on testing your plugin locally, executing sample code, and finally deploying the plugin on your TypingMind instance.

This overview provides a concise introduction to the key steps and technical requirements that will enable you to build an effective, integrated TypingMind plugin.
